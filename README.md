# AutoInstaller
This is a batch script that I made using the Windows CLI tool call "[winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)"

## How to use the AutoInstaller batch script.
The script talks to other batch files and uses the "call" function quite a lot, so when using it it's either recommended to keep the USB that it's installed on or copy and place these files to somewhere on the computer.
